# GDSPY README

Gdspy is a Python  module for creating GDSII stream files, usually CAD layouts. 
It includes a layout viewer for the geometries created, and it can also be used to import and merge GDSII files.

_Note:_

> As of version 0.5, gdspy is **NOT** backwards compatible with older versions.
> The main incompatibility is that the `layer` argument in all applicable classes and functions has been moved to a position just before `datatype` in the argument list.
> `LayoutViewer` has also been extensively improved.
> See the history of changes for all compatibility changes.

## Installation

Requirements:

* [Python](http://www.python.org/) (tested with versions 2.7 and 3.4)
* [Numpy](http://numpy.scipy.org/)
* C compiler if you are building it from source

Installation from source is as simple as:

```sh
python setup.py install
```

Gdspy can also be installed with [pip](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/):

```sh
pip install gdspy
```

Windows users will need a development environment to compile the boolean extension module (automatically performed by the install command above).

Pre-compiled Windows binaries are also offered for 32 and 64-bit systems and should be preferable for most users: [download here](https://github.com/heitzmann/gdspy/releases).

## Usage

The file gdspy-sample.py is a sample script to show the features provided by this module.
The complete module reference can be built from the sources in the `docs` folder with [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/).
It is also available [on-line](http://gdspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

* Added `L1Path` class for Manhattan geometry (L1 norm) paths.

### Version 0.1.8 (May 10, 2010)

### Version 0.1.7 (April 12, 2010)
* New visualization option: save the geometry directly to an image file (lower memory use).

* All classes were adapted to work with the boolean operations.
* The attribute size in the initializer of class `Text` does not have a default value any longer.
* The name of the argument `format` in the function `gds_view` was changed to `fill` (to avoid confusion with the built-in function `format`).

### Version 0.1.6 (December 15,  2009)
* Sample script now include comments and creates an easier to understand GDSII example.
* Improved floating point to integer rounding, which fixes the unit errors at the last digit of the precision in the GDSII file.
* Fixed the font for character 5.
